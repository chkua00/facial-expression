# Facial Expression Recogniton with Keras

## Objectives

In this course, we are going to focus on four learning objectives:

- Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras
- Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask
- Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data


## Project Structure

The hands on project on Facial Expression Recognition is divided into following tasks:

- Task 1: Introduction and Overview
- Task 2: Explore the Dataset
- Task 3: Generate Training and Validation Batches
- Task 4: Create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
- Task 5: Train and Evaluate Model
- Task 6: Save and Serialize Model as JSON String
- Task 7: Create a Flask App to Serve Predictions
- Task 8: Create a Class to Output Model Predictions
- Task 9: Design an HTML Template for the Flask App
- Task 10: Use Model to Recognize Facial Expressions in Videos
